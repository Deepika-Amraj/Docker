# Docker

 Today, I completed some essential Docker tasks as part of my DevOps journey. Here’s a quick rundown of what I learned using Docker on an AWS EC2 instance:

1️⃣ Ran a test container with `docker run hello-world` - Docker is up and running!
2️⃣ Inspected a container with `docker inspect`.
3️⃣ Listed port mappings using `docker port`.
4️⃣ Monitored container resource usage with `docker stats`.
5️⃣ Viewed running processes inside a container with `docker top`.
6️⃣ Saved and loaded images using `docker save` and `docker load`.
